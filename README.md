The main purpose of the DrivePass system was to increase the passing rates of student drivers passing their driving test.
The client for this system was DrivePass. They had the desire to create a website that would allow students to 
access learning materials and schedule driving lessons to improve their overall driving skills, safety, and odds of 
passing the drivers test. This system allows student to login to their own profile, choose different student packages,
book driving lessons, and complete learning materials.
I think what I did best was creating the UML Diagrams, specifically the class diagram. I am more of a mathematical/code minded 
individual. Overall, laying out the system in the different UML Diagrams was interesting and made it easy to grasp the full
picture of the system.
I looked at what their desires were (access online learning materials, schedule driving lessons, purchase different packages), 
and focused on the order and arrangement of the system. Firstly, the user must login. Secondly the user will subscribe to a 
certain package. Finally, the user can access their given materials or schedule driving lessons. Then taking a look at the 
nonfunctional requirements, performance, security, and adaptability, I can then start to draw up diagrams of how the system
and different users will interact in the system. These needs are important to deliver a complete and effective product to 
the customer. Lets say a simple thing such as security is overlooked, this could lead to catastrophic breaches of security
and loss of user information. This is why we include Admins and IT, case-sensitive unique passwords, and account lockouts, to 
avoid negligence when handling user information... a necessity in any system.
Before this class I would approch the process from a purely coding standpoint. Now will the understnading of Business
Requirements and System Design Diagrams, I can thoroughly approach the design process taking into account all desires and needs
of the user, functional or nonfunctional. I can also depict this information and the step by step basis of the system through 
UML diagrams. All together these tools have helped me find the whole image versus looking through the lens of a developer.
